					<p>From designing impactful marketing strategies and advancing financial inclusion in remote Indian
						villages to traveling across continents to master the art of data-driven decision-making.<br />

				<p>I grew up in India, where I completed most of my education and built over five years of professional
					experience. I come from a family rooted in resilience and ambition — my father was the first in his
					family to earn a university degree, setting a powerful example that shaped my path. Raised with the
					belief that "you either win or you learn," I’ve carried this mindset through every personal and
					professional challenge.

					After earning a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication and an MBA in Finance, I
					took the unconventional route of preparing for competitive national banking exams — a demanding
					process that ultimately led to offers from three major public-sector banks. I began my career as a
					Deputy Manager at Bank of Maharashtra and later joined India Post Payments Bank (IPPB), where my
					journey in driving innovation and impact truly began.</p>
				<p>The true turning point in my journey came when I joined India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) — a
					government-owned startup aiming to transform post offices into fully functional bank branches. As
					Assistant Manager – Strategy & Marketing, I was responsible for scaling operations across 190
					branches, impacting millions of lives in underserved regions. Working across domains like strategic
					marketing, analytics, operations, and business development, I witnessed firsthand the deep gap in
					financial access between urban and rural India. That realization shaped my mission — to serve the
					unserved. Every day brought new challenges, pushing me to think creatively and lead with purpose.
					After 4.5 years of nation-building work, I chose to expand my impact by pursuing a Master’s in
					Marketing Analytics from the University of Maryland. There, I deepened my analytical skills and
					redefined my career to blend purpose with data-driven strategy. I remain committed to continuous
					growth and learning in my current role, consistently seeking opportunities to expand my skills and
					contribute more effectively.</p>
